### What is this?

These articles show that Uber fosters a toxic corporate culture that is rife with systemic sexism and sexual harassment, among other crude behaviors. 

They show Uber's utter disregard for public safety and total disrepect of its drivers, as well as disregard for traditional taxi drivers.

They call into question the character of CEO Travis Kalanick, who appears tone-deaf, out-of-touch, and either clueless or complacent in his company's abusive culture and practices. CEOs are responsibile for laying the foundation of their company's culture. The buck stops here.

### Why is this here?

The point of this document is to provide a resource that contains all of this information all in one place. 

This is embarassing for Silicon Valley and shines a light on its worst problems. The tech industry can and should do better. Tech workers must reject this kind of culture. This industry should be a model for progressiveness, not regressive bigotry.

If you are a consumer, you can use this to decide if you still want to support this company or delete your account. **You can [delete your account here](https://help.uber.com/h/24010fe7-7a67-4ee5-9938-c734000b144a).**

If you are a tech worker, you can use this to determine if you want to work at this company. If you are contacted by a recruiter, refer them here to explain why you are not interested in working for Uber.

## Sexism, sexual harassment, 'bro' culture

### [Reflecting On One Very, Very Strange Year At Uber](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber)

> On my first official day rotating on the team, my new manager sent me a string of messages over company chat. He was in an open relationship, he said, and his girlfriend was having an easy time finding new partners but he wasn't. He was trying to stay out of trouble at work, he said, but he couldn't help getting in trouble, because he was looking for women to have sex with.

> [...]
>
> It became obvious that both HR and management had been lying about this being “his first offense”, and it certainly wasn’t his last. Within a few months, he was reported once again for inappropriate behavior, and those who reported him were told it was still his “first offense”. The situation was escalated as far up the chain as it could be escalated, and still nothing was done.

### [I am an Uber survivor.](https://medium.com/@amyvertino/my-name-is-not-amy-i-am-an-uber-survivor-c6d6541e632f#.z8xs33afd)

> On a bright and windy day last summer, while working on some updates to Uber’s driver payment system, Mike#2 proposed an idea which to me seemed as unfair to the drivers. It would block the payments to the driver if a customer complained about the ride before a ride ends. Fortunately, this never made it into the app. When we were brainstorming this idea, I openly spoke up against it. I told them that it was unethical to block a driver’s payments without researching the complaint to make sure it was the driver’s fault. Many of the Uber drivers in some countries do not own the cars they drive. They are owned by rich people who give the drivers a fixed monthly salary and take the money Uber pays the drivers from their bank accounts. So, if a payment is blocked because of a customer complaint, the drivers may go home without the pay they need to feed their families. When I voiced my concern, Mike#2 looked at me and said **"There is no place for ethics in this business sweetheart. We are not a charity."** I was upset to hear such an insensitive comment. I repeated my point and this time, I raised my voice to show that I was unhappy with his attitude. Visibly angry, Mike #2 covered the microphone of the conference phone, he reached over to hold my hand tightly and told me to **stop being a whiny little bitch.** Two of the men in the room looked at each other and laughed while the rest of the men, like me, were shocked.

> Amit Singhal has left his job at Uber as its SVP of engineering because he did not disclose to the car-hailing company that he left Google a year earlier after top executives there informed him of an allegation of sexual harassment from an employee that an internal investigation had found “credible.”

## Legal issues, 'above the law' attitude

### [A note on our lawsuit against Otto and Uber](https://medium.com/waymo/a-note-on-our-lawsuit-against-otto-and-uber-86f4f98902a1#.3u74yxywy)

> We found that six weeks before his resignation this former employee, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary design files for Waymo’s various hardware systems, including designs of Waymo’s LiDAR and circuit board. To gain access to Waymo’s design server, Mr. Levandowski searched for and installed specialized software onto his company-issued laptop. Once inside, he downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo’s highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation. Then he connected an external drive to the laptop. Mr. Levandowski then wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints. Beyond Mr. Levandowki’s actions, we discovered that other former Waymo employees, now at Otto and Uber, downloaded additional highly confidential information pertaining to our custom-built LiDAR including supplier lists, manufacturing details and statements of work with highly technical information.
>
> We believe these actions were part of a concerted plan to steal Waymo’s trade secrets and intellectual property. Months before the mass download of files, Mr. Levandowski told colleagues that he had plans to “replicate” Waymo’s technology at a competitor.

### [Uber dismissed warnings about its illegal self-driving test for months, emails show](http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/27/14698902/uber-self-driving-san-francisco-dmv-email-levandowski)

> But in multiple emails to the DMV, Anthony Levandowski, vice president at Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group and the company’s top executive in charge of autonomous technology, argued that what it was doing did not meet the legal definition of autonomous vehicle testing, spurring a brain-bending debate over the letter of the law. The debate ended inconclusively, and **Uber ultimately launched its doomed public pilot without ever notifying state regulators of its intentions to invite members of the public into the backseat of its self-driving cars.**
>
> “In their minds, they really thought they weren’t autonomous,” Jessica Gonzalez, assistant deputy director of public affairs at the DMV, told The Verge. "But we decide what’s autonomous. And under our regulations, it was."
